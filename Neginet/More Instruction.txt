- Include clear instructions on how to compile and run the submission

- The output of the program you write should be correct. Please pay attention to the instruction and the requirements on what output is needed, format, sorting order, etc

- Try to add some unit tests to check the results are correct

- Use regular expressions if possible when matching things in strings.

- Write clean code. Try to make it as simple as possible.

- Do not overkill your code by adding too many classes just to make it more robust. For example, adding Interfaces and Implementation for each class is an overhead and should not be necessary.

- Use structures that perform well with large data. Probably using a map is better than using a list on some occasions.

- Close all the resources you open.
